# Reel Random

**Reel Random** is a fun app that helps you decide what to watch next. Simply upload a CSV file of your IMDb watchlist, and the app will randomly select a movie for you. To add a bit of flair, a spinning "blank" burned disc animation will spin until it lands on your randomly chosen movie.

## Note

This was a way of challenging myself to build in pure vanilla js and html. There are some bugs that will be fixed in the future.

## Features

- **CSV Import**: Upload your IMDb watchlist as a CSV file.
- **Random Movie Selection**: Get a randomly selected movie from your watchlist to help you decide what to watch next.
- **Spinny Animation**: Enjoy a visual representation of your movie being "chosen" with a spinning blank disc animation.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
4. Open the HTML.
5. Upload your IMDb watchlist CSV and let Reel Random decide your next movie!

## CSV Format

Make sure your CSV follows the standard IMDb watchlist format. If you need to export your watchlist from IMDb, you can find the option in your account settings.

## Just for Fun

This app was built for fun and to add a little excitement to picking a movie. If you're indecisive like me, Reel Random can help make your decision-making process a bit more entertaining.
